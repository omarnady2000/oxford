      <h1 class="floating" id="top">Genral qualifications needed for <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses/admission-requirements/uk-qualifications#:~:text=To%20apply%20to%20Oxford%2C%20students,at%20least%20pass%20grade%202." target="_blank">Oxford</a></h1>
      <h3 id="sec1">A-levels</h3>
      <p>Offers for students studying A-levels range between A*A*A and AAA depending on the course. <br>
         If a practical component forms part of any of your science A‚Äêlevels used to meet your offer, we expect you to pass it. <br>
         Maths and Further Maths are viewed as separate A-Levels.</p>
      <h3 id="sec2">AS-levels and unit grades</h3>
      <p>A-levels in England are no longer modular and the majority of applicants with A-levels will therefore not have UMS marks or unit grades. <br>
         If you have completed standalone AS-levels by the time you are making your application, these can be listed as separate qualifications. <br>
         Conditional offers will be made on the basis of final A-level grades.</p>
      <h3 id="sec3">A-levels taken in or before Year 13</h3>
      <p>The usual expectation is that candidates will complete the A-levels specified in their applications within a two year period. <br>
         The Maths department and Computer Science department have each published advice for students wishing to take Maths A-level early. <br>
         There are also specific requirements which relate to students applying for Medicine.</p>
      <h3 id="sec4">Age and Stage</h3>
      <p>The University supports the general principles of Age and Stage, whereby students are allowed to progress through their educational development <br>
         and qualifications at an appropriate rate according to their ability. <br>
         However, if students are entered early for examinations, the University would still expect students to achieve at the highest level. <br>
         Poor performance could potentially have a negative effect on a future application.</p>
      <h3 id="sec5">GCSEs</h3>
      <p>GCSE grades will be considered alongside your personal statement, <br>
         academic reference, predicted grades and performance in any written work or written test required for your course. <br>
         Higher grades at GCSE can help to make your application more competitive, and successful applicants typically have a high proportion of 7,8 and 9 grades. <br>
         For those who were due to take GCSEs in 2020 and 2021, we will take into account the difficult circumstances in which these grades were issued when we assess your application. <br>
         GCSE results will be considered alongside your personal statement, academic reference, predicted grades and performance in any written work or written test required for your course. </p>
      <h3 id="sec6">Extended Project Qualifications (EPQ)</h3>
      <p>Where applicants have undertaken the EPQ, this will not be a condition of any offer but the University recognises that the EPQ will provide an <br>
         applicant with the opportunity to develop research and academic skills relevant for study at Oxford. <br>
         Candidates are encouraged to draw upon relevant EPQ experience when writing their personal statement.</p>
